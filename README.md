> **Note:** This project is in early-stage and should only be used in a sandboxed environment (VM, containers).

## Features (or maybe not yet?)

* Automate the deployment of my NixOS ecosystem
* Rassemble my system, app/services and user configuration
* Encourage modularity and composability to easily spin-up a new device.

## Quick start

So far, it doesn't look like there is a quick way to get started with flake.

## TODO

* [ ] Add a flake.nix file
* [ ] Add a minimal system, graphical environment and user home
* [ ] Include or write a deployment helper
* [ ] Include a secret encryption strategy
* [ ] Update the structure for containers, VMs
